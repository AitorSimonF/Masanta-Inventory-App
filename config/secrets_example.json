/* 

This is a template of the real credentials file.
Purpose:
Shows you which fields you need (client_id, company_id, secret, redirect uri)
Prevents you from accidentally uploading your real keys to GitHub
You copy it → rename to secrets.json → fill in your actual credentials.
And THEN you add secrets.json to .gitignore.
